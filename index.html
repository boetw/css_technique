<div class="day">
<p>Well, I woke up Sunday morning</p>
<p>With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.</p>
<p>And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,</p>
<p>So I had one more for dessert.</p>
<p>Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes</p>
<p>And found my cleanest dirty shirt.</p>
<p>Then I washed my face and combed my hair</p>
<p>And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.</p>
<br>
<p>On a Sunday morning sidewalk,</p>
<p>I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.</p>
<p>'Cause there's something in a Sunday</p>
<p>That makes a body feel alone.</p>
<p>And there's nothing short a' dying</p>
<p>That's half as lonesome as the sound</p>
<p>Of the sleeping city sidewalk</p>

</div>
<div class="night">
<p>I have been one acquainted with the night. 
<p>I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain. 
<p>I have outwalked the furthest city light. 
<br>
<p>I have looked down the saddest city lane. 
<p>I have passed by the watchman on his beat 
<p>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain. 
<br>
<p>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet 
<p>When far away an interrupted cry 
<p>Came over houses from another street, 
<br>
<p>But not to call me back or say good-bye; 
<p>And further still at an unearthly height, 
<p>One luminary clock against the sky 
<br>
<p>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
<p>I have been one acquainted with the night.
