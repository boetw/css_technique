				<p class="line1">Well, I woke up Sunday morning</p>
				<p class="line2">With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.</p>
				<p class="line3">And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,</p>
				<p class="line4">So I had one more for dessert.</p>
				<p class="line5">Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes</p>
				<p class="line6">And found my cleanest dirty shirt.</p>
				<p class="line7">Then I washed my face and combed my hair</p>
				<p class="line8">And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="line9">On a Sunday morning sidewalk,</p>
				<p class="line10">I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.</p>
				<p class="line11">'Cause there's something in a Sunday</p>
				<p class="line12">That makes a body feel alone.</p>
				<p class="line13">And there's nothing short a' dying</p>
				<p class="line14">That's half as lonesome as the sound</p>
				<p class="line15">Of the sleeping city sidewalk</p>

				<p class="line1">I have been one acquainted with the night. </p>
				<p class="line2">I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain. </p>
				<p class="line3">I have outwalked the furthest city light. </p>
				<br>
				<p class="line5">I have looked down the saddest city lane. </p>
				<p class="line6">I have passed by the watchman on his beat </p>
				<p class="line7">And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain. </p>
				<br>
				<p class="line9">I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet</p>
				<p class="line10">When far away an interrupted cry </p>
				<p class="line11">Came over houses from another street,</p>
				<br>
				<p class="line12">But not to call me back or say good-bye; </p>
				<p class="line13">And further still at an unearthly height, </p>
				<p class="line14">One luminary clock against the sky </p>
				<br>
				<p class="line16">Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p>
				<p class="line17">I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
